##  Overview

### Project Overview: Interactive Machine Learning Visualizations

Welcome to an exciting journey into the world of machine learning through interactive visualizations! This project is designed to make complex concepts accessible and engaging, using a combination of powerful libraries like TensorFlow, Matplotlib, and Manim. Whether you're a beginner looking to understand the basics or an experienced practitioner seeking deeper insights, this project has something for everyone.

#### What Does This Project Do?

At its core, this project aims to demystify machine learning by creating interactive and visually appealing animations. It covers a range of topics from simple perceptron models to multi-layer neural networks, all while using real-world datasets like the Iris dataset and MNIST digit recognition data. Here’s a quick breakdown of what you can expect:

1. **Educational Animations**: Using Manim, we create detailed animations that explain how different machine learning models work. From single perceptrons to complex multi-layer perceptrons, each step is visualized to help you understand the underlying mechanics.

2. **Real-World Applications**: We apply these models to real datasets. For example, you'll see how a simple perceptron can classify different species of Iris flowers and how a more advanced model can recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

3. **Step-by-Step Tutorials**: Each script is designed to guide you through the process of data fetching, preprocessing, training, testing, and evaluating models. This hands-on approach ensures that you not only see the results but also understand how they are achieved.

4. **Testing and Validation**: We include scripts like `test.py` to validate the functionality of our models. These tests help ensure that everything works as expected and provide a way to debug any issues that arise
